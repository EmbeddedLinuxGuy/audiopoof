Out to the serial port then on to the RS-485 network, the format is:

!XXYZ.

!    = start of new settings
XX = two digits giving the box number, starting at 1, in hexadecimal
    (example: 01, 02, .. 09, 0a, 0b, ... , 0f, 10, ......)
Y = digit specifying what to change (1,2,.... = poofer solenoid)
Z = what to do; 1 = turn on, 0 = turn off
.  = end of message

You can include a newline at the end for readability. If you don't, the message is 6 characters long.

Each has a timer, and repeated "on" messages must be sent or the circuit turns off. This is for both igniters and poofers at the moment.

I haven't screwed with the timeouts yet but I think we said half a second.

It's 19200 baud, N, 8, 1.


I'll give some examples just to be overly clear:

Turn on box one, outlet one.
!0111.

Turn off, outlet three on box one.
!0130.

Turn on box ten outlet four (which is igniter one)
!0A41.

Turn off box seventeen outlet 2
!1120.
